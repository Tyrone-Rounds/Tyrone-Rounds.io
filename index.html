		<h2>Programming and Me</h2>
		<h3>by Tyrone Rounds</h3>

		<p class="quote">I've been practicing programming for over a year now, but I learned my first programming languages, C and C++, almost 10 years ago. Programming is easy to learn, but it's also easy to forget if you don't practice. That's part of the reason for such a long time between my learning and doing anything here to showcase my skills (not to mention I've only recently heard of GitHub). I work as a NERC certified Transmission Operator. It does pay well (around six figures in some places), and I've worked for some interesting companies. Click here to learn more about that line of work: <a href = "https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Functional%20Model%20Advisory%20Group%20DL/Functional_Model_V5.1_clean_10082019.pdf">Transmission Operator Job Description</a> page 39.</p>

		<p>I'm more interested in programming lately for a few reason: It's so much fun that I can do it for hours without even realizing so much time has passed by; with the world temporarily changing due to coronavirus, distance work is looking more attractive, and web programming is one job that you can do remotely that pays a decent salary, so I've considered a career in programming. I like learning new languages. I hold an associates's degree in engineering, and a bachelor's degree in business economics. I've learned HTML, C, C++, FORTRAN, and some Visual Basic in school. So far I've learned on my own CSS, Javascript, PHP, and a bit of MySQL and Python. I mostly write functional programs. My artwork could use some work.</p>
		<p>One thing I can say about programming languages is this: if you know even one of them well, then many of the others are extraordinarily similar. C, C++, Python, PHP, Javascript all have practically the same syntax. MySQL, HTML are completely different. I've watched some videos where the person teaching a programming class swears you have to learn every detail of a particular language to be a good programmer. Some say it's better to learn the basics, and rely on libraries. I have mixed feelings about libraries. Libraries do speed up programming times, but they also make you a lazy programmer since you don't actually learn how to write certain programs which kind of makes you an end-user, and not a programmer. If you're pressed for time then libraries are the way to go, but if you have time, I think it's better to write the script yourself in my opinion. I've used Bootstrap for CSS, and I've dabbled in AJAX and JQuery.</p>
		
		<p>I use the words <i>script, program, and algorithm</i> interchangeably. I have also seen that this discussion has been the subject of many debates. The only real difference is that a scripting language like Javascript is not compiled, but a language like Python uses a compiler. With that admittedly over-simplified explanation, all that it means is that the language used is a scripting language or not, but the actual steps used can be called a program, a script, or an algorithm.  </p>
		<p>Well enough of my musings on the philosophy of programming. Here's a list of a few more websites I've done. :
